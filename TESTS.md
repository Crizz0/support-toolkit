## PHPUnit
The Support Toolkit unit tests use PHPUnit framework. Version 3.5 or 
better is required to run the tests. PHPUnit prefers to be installed
via PEAR; refer to http://www.phpunit.de/ for more information.

## Running
Once the prerequisites are installed, run the tests from the project root directory (above `stk/`):
	$ phpunit
